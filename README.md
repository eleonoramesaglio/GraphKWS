## ðŸ“– Overview  

Keyword Spotting (KWS) enables devices to detect specific spoken words efficiently, a critical task for voice assistants and embedded systems.  

In this work, we propose **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** architectures for KWS, representing audio spectrograms as graphs where temporal frames are modeled as nodes. Our contributions include:  

- **Graph-based representation of audio** using sparse, cosine similarityâ€“based adjacency with dilated connectivity.  
- **Balanced message passing** via Graph Convolutional layers and attention mechanisms for noise robustness.  
- **Reduced node representations** for flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.  

Our models achieve:  
- **Low-footprint variant (18.4k parameters)**: matches state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing multiplies by Ã—3.  
- **Medium-footprint variant (151k parameters)**: reaches **94.68% accuracy**, using **23% fewer parameters** than previous attention-based approaches.  

To our knowledge, this is the **first work applying GNNs to keyword spotting**, demonstrating their potential as lightweight and scalable alternatives to CNN-based models.
