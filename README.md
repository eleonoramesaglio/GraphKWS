## Overview

We work on the reference *dataset* for small-footprint keyword spotting, collected by [AIY](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/) and released in August 2017 (you can download it at this [link](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz)). 
The dataset contains:
- *65,000* one-second-long utterances of *30 words*
- said by thousands of different people.

Our objective is to correctly detect a selected subset of words/commands, the keywords, in the spoken signal.
